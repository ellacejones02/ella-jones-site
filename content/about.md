### Hi There,

I'm a Computer Science & Data Science Student at Northwestern University, passionate about technology and innovation. After graduation, I will be working in Chicago as an analyst at The Jordan Company, L.P. (Private Equity).

In my sparetime, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and family, running, cycling, cooking and baking, and watercolor painting!
